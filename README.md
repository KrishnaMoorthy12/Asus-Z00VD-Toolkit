## README
 ++ Instructions:
 1. This toolkit is only for ASUS Z00VD (ZC500TG).
 2. This toolkit is built to work only on Windows platform Operating Systems.
 3. Eventhough, only flashing the recoveries can harm other devices.
 4. Bootloader unlock and lock methods may vary form device to device.
 5. Using this method may or may not unlock or lock other devices, but will not harm them.
    Better don't try.
 6. Reboot, sideload, driver installation features will work for all devices.
 7. You will need to enable 'Driver signature reinforcement' option from the 'Advanced Restart' menu
    in the latest versions (Windows 8+) of Windows Operating Systems to install the ADB drivers.
 8. Make sure all the ADB drivers are installed properly before performing any operations.
 9. Do not modify/ change/ remove any files from the working directory. Only essential files are kept.
10. I have include two toolkits in this. One is for 32-bit operating systems and other is for
    64-bit operating systems. Choose the appropriate version.

 ++ Warning:
 1. Unlocking your device will void your warrenty.
 2. Rooting your phone can harm your device if it's not done properly.
 3. Flashing incompatible zip files can cause boot-loops and even hard-bricks.
 4. I'm not responsible for any bricked/ boot-looped devices.
 5. Do not remove your USB cable during any process.
 6. Some of the options in the tool can result in loss of user data. Take a backup before
    doing such processes.
